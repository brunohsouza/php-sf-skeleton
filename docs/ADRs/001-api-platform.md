# Using API-Platform as project base

Date: 2021-07-17

## Context

As the project is initializing and it is needed some API architecture using Symfony as framework. The developer had to
decide between use the fos-rest-bundle and the API-Platform.

## Decision

The decision to use API-Platform was done due to the Symfony recipe documentation incentive and use it as API based
architecture.

The API-Platform is a nice API framework which brings some facilities during the development. However also brings some
time to learning how it works under the woods, and it is now always an easy job to do.

During the first talk, the company also said the intention to use API-Platform in some projects.

## Pros:
* Brings a lot of components ready to use;
* Has a lot of Symfony components integrations;
* Forces the good practices of development;
* Is up-to-date with the best approaches and tools on the market;

## Cons
* Some components take more time to learn how it works;
* Has some fixed approaches which are hard to make something out of its way;
